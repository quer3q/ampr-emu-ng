# AGENTS.md

Notes for coding agents working on ampr-emu-ng (version 0.1.0, GPL-3.0-or-later).

## Project

ampr-emu-ng is a `no_std` Rust rewrite of drakmor/ampr_emu: the PS5 fakelib
`libSceAmpr.sprx`, which emulates the AMPR/APR file APIs for games run from
dumps. One runtime serves LZ4 packs (`AMPRPAK4`) and zstd packs (`AMPRZPK1`
index, `AMPRZDT1` volumes), picked at load by whether
`/app0/ampr_zstd.index` exists (`crates/ampr-sys/src/rt/pack/mod.rs`).

## Layout

- `crates/ampr-sys`: PRX runtime (staticlib). Runtime code is in `src/rt/`
  (pack, reactor, hooks, stats, tune, exports).
- `crates/ampr-format`: shared index readers, byte helpers and overlay utilities.
- `crates/ampr-codec`: zstd decode.
- `crates/ampr-lz4`: AMPRPAK4 manifest, AMPRDAT3 header, read planning and LZ4 decode.
- `crates/ampr-command`, `ampr-hook`: APR command encoding and x86 hook decoding.
- `crates/ampr-zstd`: zstd pack format, decode side only (`no_std`).
- `ps5/`: Dockerfile, `build-docker.sh`, target spec, PRX linker script.
- `tools/`: Python PRX post-processing and `verify_payload_prx.py`.
- `docs/zstd-format.md`: the zstd pack format. Keep it in sync with
  `crates/ampr-zstd`.

## Build and test

```sh
cargo test --workspace                         # host tests
./ps5/build-docker.sh                          # make dist: release + debug .sprx, verified
./ps5/build-docker.sh verify                   # release build + verifier only
./ps5/build-docker.sh dist AMPR_PACK_WORKERS=8 # override a Makefile knob
./ps5/build-docker.sh clean                    # remove out/
```

Knobs and their defaults are at the top of the `Makefile`
(`AMPR_INTERNAL_POOL_SIZE`, `AMPR_PACK_WORKERS`, read-ahead, read extension,
`AMPR_ZSTD_LIBC_HOOKS`, `AMPR_MEM_REPORT`). A knob change rebuilds through
`out/*/obj/build-config.txt`.
CI (`.github/workflows/build.yml`) runs the same commands; a pushed `v*` tag creates a release with both `.sprx` and `SHA256SUMS`.

## Conventions

- Runtime crates are `no_std` (`ampr-sys` is `no_std` outside tests). Do not
  pull `std` into them.
- No new dependencies without a stated reason. Runtime dependencies use
  `default-features = false`, and `lz4_flex`, `zstd-sys`, `iced-x86` are
  pinned (`=x.y.z`); follow that.
- Memory budget: the release pool is 88 MiB (`0x5800000`); measured peaks are
  79.9 MiB (LZ4) and 73.3 MiB (zstd). Any change that grows runtime memory
  needs a measurement and an updated Makefile comment.
- Comments: plain prose `//!` and `///`, saying why, with the measured numbers
  and the source they come from (e.g. `rt/stats.rs`). Large files group items under
  `// ---- topic ----` section lines; keep that style.
- Naming: the zstd format is "zstd packs" and the project is "ampr-emu-ng".
  Do not use other names for the format or the project in code, docs or
  file names.
- Markdown: ASCII punctuation, no emoji.

## Verifying a change

1. `cargo test --workspace` passes on the host.
2. `./ps5/build-docker.sh verify` (or `dist`) passes; it runs
   `tools/verify_payload_prx.py` on the linked PRX and SPRX.
3. Runtime behavior changes need a run on a console with
   `libSceAmpr-debug.sprx`: read `http://<ps5-ip>:9090/metrics` before and
   after and compare game wait per read, pack job and disk read latency.

## Benchmark data

Performance numbers in `README.md` and the Makefile comments come from
on-console runs read from the debug build's `/metrics` page. Raw run data is
not kept in the repo; state the game, build and settings next to new numbers.

## Do not commit

Build outputs: `*.sprx`, `out/`, `target/` (all in `.gitignore`). Do not add
binaries or game data to the repo.
